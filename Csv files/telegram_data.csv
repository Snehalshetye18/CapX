2024-11-28 12:58:51+00:00,5158919417,"20 GOLDEN RULES FOR TRADERS

1. Forget the news, remember the chart. You're not smart enough to know how news will affect price. The chart already knows the news is coming.

2. Buy the first pullback from a new high. Sell the first pullback from a new low. There's always a crowd that missed the first boat.

3. Buy at support, sell at resistance. Everyone sees the same thing and they're all just waiting to jump in the pool.

4. Short rallies not selloffs. When markets drop, shorts finally turn a profit and get ready to cover.

5. Don't buy up into a major moving average or sell down into one. See #3.

6. Don't chase momentum if you can't find the exit. Assume the market will reverse the minute you get in. If it's a long way to the door, you're in big trouble.

7. Exhaustion gaps get filled. Breakaway and continuation gaps don't. The old traders' wisdom is a lie. Trade in the direction of gap support whenever you can.

8. Trends test the point of last support/resistance. Enter here even if it hurts.

9. Trade with the TICK not against it. Don't be a hero. Go with the money flow.

10. If you have to look, it isn't there. Forget your college degree and trust your instincts.

11. Sell the second high, buy the second low. After sharp pullbacks, the first test of any high or low always runs into resistance. Look for the break on the third or fourth try.

12. The trend is your friend in the last hour. As volume cranks up at 3:00pm don't expect anyone to change the channel.

13. Avoid the open. They see YOU coming sucker

14. 1-2-3-Drop-Up. Look for downtrends to reverse after a top, two lower highs and a double bottom.

15. Bulls live above the 200 day, bears live below. Sellers eat up rallies below this key moving average line and buyers to come to the rescue above it.

16. Price has memory. What did price do the last time it hit a certain level? Chances are it will do it again.

17. Big volume kills moves. Climax blow-offs take both buyers and sellers out of the market and lead to sideways action.

18. Trends never turn on a dime. Reversals build slowly. The first sharp dip always finds buyers and the first sharp rise always finds sellers.

19. Bottoms take longer to form than tops. Greed acts more quickly than fear and causes stocks to drop from their own weight.

20. Beat the crowd in and out the door. You have to take their money before they take yours, period."

A big move is likely if it crosses 24,240 on the upside or falls below 24,140, which could lead to panic.

Right now, the market is range-bound, but to catch the trend, one must take a position in advance. Once the move starts, it’s hard to jump in."

Learning helps in earning and learning new thing is good. 

In trading most of us follow this quote quite seriously. This leads to learning every tom dick Harry indicator/chart pattern/scanner out there and trying new strategy each day. Then blend and adjust according to our style which leads to losses.

Instead Try these
- Keep 1-2 max indicators on chart
- Focus more on PRICE and VOLUME 
- Work hard on least risk entry points
- Part book in strength
- Define risk per trade"

➡️Just see how smart they are. Shorting since September last week till 13th November. From 14th November they start covering silently by keeping Nifty flat in 200 points range at 23500(+-200) and booked out more than half of total shorts

2024-11-28 12:58:51+00:00,5158919417,"20 GOLDEN RULES FOR TRADERS

1. Forget the news, remember the chart. You're not smart enough to know how news will affect price. The chart already knows the news is coming.

2. Buy the first pullback from a new high. Sell the first pullback from a new low. There's always a crowd that missed the first boat.

3. Buy at support, sell at resistance. Everyone sees the same thing and they're all just waiting to jump in the pool.

4. Short rallies not selloffs. When markets drop, shorts finally turn a profit and get ready to cover.

5. Don't buy up into a major moving average or sell down into one. See #3.

6. Don't chase momentum if you can't find the exit. Assume the market will reverse the minute you get in. If it's a long way to the door, you're in big trouble.

7. Exhaustion gaps get filled. Breakaway and continuation gaps don't. The old traders' wisdom is a lie. Trade in the direction of gap support whenever you can.

8. Trends test the point of last support/resistance. Enter here even if it hurts.

9. Trade with the TICK not against it. Don't be a hero. Go with the money flow.

10. If you have to look, it isn't there. Forget your college degree and trust your instincts.

11. Sell the second high, buy the second low. After sharp pullbacks, the first test of any high or low always runs into resistance. Look for the break on the third or fourth try.

12. The trend is your friend in the last hour. As volume cranks up at 3:00pm don't expect anyone to change the channel.

13. Avoid the open. They see YOU coming sucker

14. 1-2-3-Drop-Up. Look for downtrends to reverse after a top, two lower highs and a double bottom.

15. Bulls live above the 200 day, bears live below. Sellers eat up rallies below this key moving average line and buyers to come to the rescue above it.

16. Price has memory. What did price do the last time it hit a certain level? Chances are it will do it again.

17. Big volume kills moves. Climax blow-offs take both buyers and sellers out of the market and lead to sideways action.

18. Trends never turn on a dime. Reversals build slowly. The first sharp dip always finds buyers and the first sharp rise always finds sellers.

19. Bottoms take longer to form than tops. Greed acts more quickly than fear and causes stocks to drop from their own weight.

20. Beat the crowd in and out the door. You have to take their money before they take yours, period."

Learning helps in earning and learning new thing is good. 

In trading most of us follow this quote quite seriously. This leads to learning every tom dick Harry indicator/chart pattern/scanner out there and trying new strategy each day. Then blend and adjust according to our style which leads to losses.

Instead Try these
- Keep 1-2 max indicators on chart
- Focus more on PRICE and VOLUME 
- Work hard on least risk entry points
- Part book in strength
- Define risk per trade"

➡️Just see how smart they are. Shorting since September last week till 13th November. From 14th November they start covering silently by keeping Nifty flat in 200 points range at 23500(+-200) and booked out more than half of total shorts

For FY24E and FY25E, as of date, incorporating the revised PAT estimates for Nifty constituents, we are seeing ~5% earnings downgrade to our Nifty estimates.

As of now, we stick to our Nifty target of 27,500; valuing the index at 22x PE on FY26E.

With decent correction underway, we advise clients to step up investments in quality stocks offering healthy growth longevity."

The HDFC Bank chart shows a clear trend: after every 2-3 years of consolidation, we see a strong run-up. But this time, the consolidation has been even longer—4 years!

If it breaks out and sustains, we could see a significant upside move. Let’s see if it follows the trend this time with a run-up, or if there’s a breakdown instead. Stay tuned!"

""So how's your home life?"" asks the first multimillionaire.

""Couldn't be better,"" replies the second multimillionaire. ""I bought an elephant!""

""An elephant? Are you crazy?""

""It's the best purchase I ever made! He grazes the lawn and makes it nice and even. The kids love to ride him and slide down his trunk, so now they are playing outside and being kids instead of just watching TV all day. My wife loves him, too. He's very strong and helps her move things when I'm not around. Honestly, I can't think of a better pet.""

The first multimillionaire thinks for a moment. ""That's actually kind of amazing. How much did you pay for him?""

""Five hundred thousand dollars. What a bargain, huh?""

""Can I buy him for one million dollars?""

""What?! I can't sell him. He's part of my family now!""

""Okay. Two million?""

""You can't put a price on something so useful!""

""Three million?""

""Fine. I'll sell him for three million dollars, but only because you're my friend.""

A few months later, the multimillionaires meet again. The first multimillionaire is raging.

""The elephant may have been useful to you, but he's a burden to me. He may have grazed your lawn, but he ate all my trees and left dung all over my lawn. The kids are terrified of that huge, noisy, aggressive thing. My wife and I haven't had a good night's sleep in months because the elephant keeps us awake. It's the worst purchase I ever made!""

""I don't know what to say,"" says the second multimillionaire. ""But with that attitude, you'll never be able to sell him !!!""

1) Work in site from Indian companies will not get visa 
Indian IT companies has to recruit American only for work on site for every 1 employee India will lose 5 employees get laid off

2) Work permit will restricted

3) Students who wants to Study in Usa will have lesser chance 

4) students who are already studying in Usa will not get work permit in Usa after studies will be sent back 

5) Green visa will be restricted very less nos will be sanctioned 

6) Exports of Steel and  other export products  which is imported from india duty will be increased to make trade deal will with usa and India which gives supremacy for Space X to enter in to Indian markets with the conditions of importing tesla cars in low import duty tax  and Starlink innovations in india 

7) Dollar will strengthen To 90-95-98+ 

8) global crisis will happen in  Nxt few years and economy will slow down 

9) Automobile industry will have a Hit companies which are manufacturing and supplying the finished product in auto products will charged high tax for exporting to usa which will be forced to open plants in Usa for future supply and increase the job for Americans 

10)Strengthening the borders 

11) pharma industry and Indian textile industries will have good boom 

12) cutting of trade deals with europe charging high tax to importing in to Usa especially in Textile and fashion products in case Europe is not purchasing as much usa is importing from Europe 

13) Will cut Nato funding 

14) rig oil more to less the crude oil prices from Usa not support green energy believes only on fossil fuel 

15) Corporate tax cut to boom economy and hire new jobs for Americans other countries national will have very less opportunity to get jobs in Usa 
Existing Indian and other national working in Usa unless he is super talented if he is important for the organisation will be given visa or else will be laid off and give opportunity for Americans

Indian equity markets to be rangebound with an increase in volatility as we enter an eventful week. All eyes will be on the US presidential elections scheduled to be held on November 5, as there has been a tight race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Interest rate decision by the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) with expected rate cut of 25bps on November 7 is also in focus. Bank of England will also announce its interest rate decision on November 7.
U.S. stocks rallied on Friday to kick off November as Amazon led big technology stocks into the green and traders looked past a disappointing jobs report."

2024-10-29 21:40:10+00:00,6457676279,"SEBI’s New Rules for Index Derivatives: Impact on Retail Investors

Dear team, On October 1, 2024, SEBI announced changes to index derivatives with circular no. SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD-1/P/CIR/2024/132, set to take effect starting November 20, 2024. Here’s a summary of the key changes and their implications for retail investors.

1. Increase in Contract Size (Effective from Nov 20, 2024)

New Contract Values: The contract sizes for index F&O contracts will increase from ₹5-10 lakhs to ₹15-20 lakhs. This means higher lot sizes and, consequently, larger margin requirements.

Revised Lot Sizes:

o Nifty 50: From 25 to 75

o Nifty Bank: From 15 to 30

o Nifty Financial Services: From 25 to 65

o Nifty Midcap Select: From 50 to 120

o Nifty Next 50: From 10 to 25

o Sensex: From 10 to 20

o Bankex: From 15 to 30

o Sensex 50: From 25 to 60

This will be effective for all new index derivatives contracts (includes weekly, monthly, quarterly and half-yearly) introduced from November 20, 2024, onwards.

For more details, please refer NSE circular number NSE/FAOP/64625 dated Oct 18, 2024 and BSE notice number 20241021-13 dated Oct 21, 2024.

2. No Calendar Spread Benefits on Expiry Day (Effective from Feb 01, 2025)

Starting February 1, 2025, traders will not receive margin benefits for calendar spreads on expiry day.

3. Limiting Weekly Expiry Contracts (Effective from Nov 20, 2024)

Only the Nifty 50 and Sensex will have weekly expiry contracts from November 20, 2024.

4. Additional Margins on Expiry Day (Effective from Nov 20, 2024)

An Extreme Loss Margin (ELM) of 2% will be applied to short positions (selling options) on expiry day to cover potential risks due to increased volatility.

5. Upfront Collection of Premium for Options (Effective from Feb 01, 2025)

Buyers of options must pay the entire premium upfront.

Nothing changes for you at Swastika, as we have always collected option premium upfront for buying options.

6. Intraday Monitoring of Position Limits (Effective from Apr 01, 2025)

Position limits will be monitored throughout the trading day starting April 1, 2025. Currently, these limits are monitored at the end of each day by the exchanges."

Many people were asking why are we not much Active in last few months..
We preferred to stay active with private clients in Volatile & Choppy markets as not possible to guide people at large in such market where direction keeps changing on daily basis..

From last few months we had Alerted very clearly that Midcaps & Smallcaps are not giving comfort..
Clear & Bold View was to shift to IT Stock..
Now see, Other stocks & sectors have corrected alot but IT Stocks are nearly at Highs only👍😊

Though Markets didn't follow Exact levels in Nifty as we never expected it to Sustain above 25k..
But Overall MotaMoti view went Correct & as We stayed out majorly with Sell on Rise views ✅🙏🏻

@SharesNservices Our FreshView Now.:

Now, 
Stock Specific markets has corrected quite well & Many Stocks are at good valuation & OverSold Zone..👍
It's not the Time to Panic & Fresh Sell,

From Today till Diwali..

2024-10-24 05:31:32+00:00,730832970,"Many people are asking possible bottom levels on Nifty.

My POV: Its simple, but not easy! Its impossible to pin point a top or a bottom consistently and if some does so I would be more than happy to meet. Fixating on a level removes flexibility which is a must in our profession. 

Hence, once we feel there is a high probability of a bottom in place, we shall communicate. 

Until then stay safe!"
